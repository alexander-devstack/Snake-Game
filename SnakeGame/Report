Snake Game – Setup & Run Instructions

Requirements:
- Python 3.10 or higher installed on your system
- A desktop environment that supports the built-in 'turtle' graphics module

Project files:
- main.py          → Entry point for the game
- snake.py         → Snake movement and body segment logic
- Food.py          → Food object logic and random positioning
- scoreboard.py    → Score and high-score handling (uses data.txt for persistence)
- data.txt         → Stores the saved high score

How to run:
1. Ensure all the above files are in the same folder.
2. Make sure Python 3 is installed and added to your PATH.
3. Open a terminal in this folder and run:
   python main.py
4. Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to control the snake.

Notes:
- The 'data.txt' file must be present in the same directory; it will be updated automatically when you beat the previous high score.
- The game window will close when you click inside it after the game ends.
